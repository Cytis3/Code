 <p>If you never played it, you may already at least be familiar with Hoyoverse and their flagship gacha game <b>Genshin Impact</b>. This colorful anime game sets you down in Teyvat, a sprawling open world full of charming characters, varied enemies, and cute but deadly slimes. These slime enemies are just one aspect of Genshin Impact’s elemental mechanic, as each member of your party is skilled in a specific set of elements that are incredibly impactful against some enemies, but might be completely negated by others.</p>
 
 <p>Using <b>Genshin Impact’s</b> gacha mechanics, you can unlock a range of new characters and start building a rounded team that can go toe-to-toe against any enemy and any element. Teyvat keeps expanding, too, with new areas and characters arriving in regular updates, introducing new elements, enemies, storylines, and quests. To get you started, make sure you’ve redeemed the latest Genshin Impact codes to help you unlock characters and level up fast.</p>
